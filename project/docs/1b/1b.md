Project Assignment 1b - Due Wednesday November 5th at Midnight!

BEFORE YOU START WORKING: make sure to delete your Board.jar from the lib folder. See the bottom of this document for exact instructions.

For this assignment you will be writing two core classes for the board package of the project, Tile and SimpleGameBoard. We will be supplying you with the interface and abstract class, as well as the javaDocs, for these classes.

Tile and SimpleGameBoard make up the core of our game. An instance of Tile represents a hexagonal node (or space) on the gameboard. A Tile instance will have a Point that has an x and y coordinate, as well as a PlayerColor that represents the player whose color that Tile is (note that Blank should be used when no player controls a Tile, at least in the standard rules). Tiles can be constructed in two ways: one way gives you an x and y that help you to construct the point that tile occupies, and the second way takes another Tile instance and creates a new Tile that is a copy of the given Tile. The rest of the methods needed for Tile are listed in the javaDocs, and should be very similar to many of the methods you wrote in Move last week.

SimpleGameBoard inherits from a class as well as an interface. This means that it must implement the three methods from Board that do not already have a body in Board, namely getNeighbors, makeMove and getTileAt. SimpleGameBoard also has two constructors, similar to Tile, one that explicitly gives values for the class fields, and another that takes an existing Board and makes a copy. See the javaDocs for more information on those constructors.

Here are the method descriptions for three methods that you will need to write in SimpleGameBoard:

makeMove takes in a PlayerColor and a move and makes that move for that player if that move is legal for that player. Note: If you checked for legality in your Rules, you do not need to check legality again in your SimpleGameBoard. You simply need to make the given move by altering the tiles.

getTileAt returns the tile with the specified coordinates. Note: Be careful to handle the goal nodes appropriately, but also handle the case where you attempt to select something outside the bounds of the board. If you try to get at something outside the board, you do need to have a return statement, not simply throw an exception. This is because you have other code that depends on this return, and your game should not error simply because the move got through your legality check in Rules.

getNeighbors returns all adjacent tiles to the current tile, regardless of color. Note: Think about the edge cases in order to have this return the correct Set. How do you handle the goal nodes? If the goal nodes are Tiles, what point are they stored at?

For more information on the assignment, including additional high-level details about the classes you will be implementing, please see the Board interface, along with the AbstractBoard class for this assignment.  Please reference the javaDocs frequently as they should help clarify what you need to do and help you think about how you might go about doing it.

1) Navigate to your C212/c212-submissions directory and run git start.

2) Read through the descriptions of each of the new classes and their methods.

3) Implement two new classes (Tile and SimpleGameBoard) according to the specifications in the javaDocs you read in 2).  Again, when reading javaDocs, please remember that private methods and fields are not included.  It is up to you to decide how you implement everything as long as you include everything you find in the javaDocs.

4) Once you feel confident that your classes are working as instructed, put javaDoc author tags for you and your partner at the top of your file as you did in the first part of the project.
	
5) Make sure you've saved your work, then submit it to github. Check github to make sure your work is there.

6) As always, talk to your partner, google, e-mail the listserv, and/or come to office hours if you have questions.

7) Project Assignment 1b is due Wednesday, November 5th, at midnight!


Guide to deleting Board.jar:

Open your lib folder in your Package Explorer in Eclipse. Right click the Board.jar file as shown below and click Delete. (alternatively, highlight Board.jar and press the Delete key on your keyboard.)

You will see a confirmation prompt. Click yes.

You will then see a prompt for project references. This is also fine.

Now that you have successfully removed Board.jar you will need to update your classpath. To do this, right click your project and select properties, then go to Java Build Path and open the Libraries Tab. You should see a reference to Board.jar here, this is the reference that needs to be removed, so remove it.
