Extension Selected?
Very brief attempt made on the first one (it might work), more extensive attempt on Extension 2.
What you were able to accomplish towards completing this extension?
I think I might have completed the first one, though it seemed too easy so I know I overlooked something big.  The second one I struggled with, and though I could conceptualize the problem, implementation proved diffocult.
What problems did you encounter?
I was a little foggy on scope for Extension 2.  
How did you overcome those problems?
I'm not sure I did.
What problems were you unable to solve?
Currently the code is not functioning as I intended.  However, I've still got some time left to 
How would you try to solve these problems if you had more time? (Be as specific as possible!) 

I would read up on scope, particularly if in a loop I can modify variables defined in that method but prior to beginning said loop.  
My goal with determing distance to the center of the board revolved around first calculating the middle point.  I then iterated through the list of 
legal moves.  if the exact center of the board was not yet taken, that was the move to make.  Othewise, I wanted to iterate through every legal move and
compare the absolute sum of each x distance and y distance.  the smallest distance would then correspond to the move to make.  Things got dicey though.
